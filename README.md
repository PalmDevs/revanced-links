## Getting Started
Here's an example snippet to get latest essentials for ReVanced app building.  
If you want the full documentation, please refer to [here](https://palmdevs.github.io/revanced-links/) instead.

### Get essentials for patching YouTube

```js
import { ReVancedLinks, App } from 'revanced-links'

// All the options are optional
const rl = new ReVancedLinks({
    appFetcherSettings: {
        arch: 'arm64-v8a'
    },
    gitHubSettings: {
        apiKey: 'secret123',
        dataPerPage: 10,
    }
})

const { patches, integrations, cli } = await rl.revanced.fetchLatestReleases()
const youtube = await rl.packages.fetchLatestRelease(App.YouTube)

// Do something with the URLs
console.log('Patches assets:', patches)
console.log('Integration assets:', integrations)
console.log('CLI assets:', cli)
console.log('Latest YouTube package:', youtube)
```

### Get latest patchable app packages

```js
import { AppPackageFetcher, App } from 'revanced-links'

const apf = new AppPackageFetcher({
    arch: 'arm64-v8a'
})

const availableAppIDs = [App.Reddit, App.TikTok, App.Twitter, App.WarnWetter, App.YouTube, App.YouTubeMusic]
const linkEntries = await Promise.all(availableAppIDs.map(
    async (id) => {
        return [App[id], await apf.fetchLatestRelease(id)]
    }
))

const links = Object.fromEntries(linkEntries)

console.log('YouTube: ', links.YouTube)
console.log('YouTube Music: ', links.YouTubeMusic)
// ...
```

### Scrape unrelated app packages (BETA, may not work with some apps)

```js
import { APKMirrorScraper } from 'revanced-links'

const ams = new APKMirrorScraper({
    arch: 'arm64-v8a'
})

const gWalletDownloadUrl = ams.fetchDownload('google-inc/google-wallet', '2.153.469766798')
console.log(gWalletDownloadUrl)
```

## Contribute
To contribute, fork the `main` branch and then make a pull request.  
Please note that some pull requests may not be merged/rebased. Don't be mad about it, other people get that too.

### Setting up the environment
Make sure these are installed:
 - **Node v18.x.x**
 - **Git**
 - Preferably VSCode (but you can use other editors)
 - GitHub Desktop (if you need it)

To clone this repository, you could use GitHub Desktop, or `git` in command-line

git clone https://github.com/PalmDevs/revanced-links
```
Then you'll need to install libraries
```sh
npm install
# or if you use yarn
yarn install
```

### Scripts
When there are scripts, there are productivity. Here's a list of scripts you should know about.  
**Note**: Anything ending in `:nc` means no-cleanup, this usually results in junk files and weird errors.
  - `watch`, `start`, `start:nc`: Starts the development environment, your code will automatically compile on save
  - `compile`, `compile:nc`: Only compiles the code, doesn't make documentation
  - `docs`, `docs:nc`: Only makes documentation, doesn't compile code
  - `cleanup`: This script is ran by other scripts, but this deletes `dist/` and `docs/`
  - `build`, `build:nc`: Builds both documentation and distribution

### You're ready!
You're ready to be cool like a hackerman. ðŸ˜Ž  
Now you can brag to your non-programmer friends about it!
