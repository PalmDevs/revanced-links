### Get essentials from GitHub

```
Then you'll need to install the development libraries
```sh

### Scripts
When there are scripts, there are productivity. Here's a list of scripts you should know about.  
**Note**: Anything ending in `:nc` means no-cleanup, this usually results in junk files and possibly weird errors.
  - `watch`, `start`, `start:nc`: Starts the development environment, your code will automatically compile on save
  - `compile`, `compile:nc`: Only compiles the code, doesn't make documentation
  - `docs`, `docs:nc`: Only makes documentation, doesn't compile code
  - `build`, `build:nc`: Builds both documentation and distribution
  - `cleanup`: This script is ran by other scripts, but this deletes `dist/` and `docs/`
  - `test`: Just tests the whole library

### You're ready!
You're ready to be cool like a hackerman. ðŸ˜Ž  
Now you can brag to your non-programmer friends about it!
