 - GitHub Desktop

To clone this repository, you could use GitHub Desktop, or `git` in command-line.
```sh

```
Then you'll need to install the development libraries

```
#### Update your environment variables
See the `.env.example` file for more information.

### Scripts
There are scripts! Here's a list of scripts you should know about.  
**Note**: Anything ending in `:nc` means no-cleanup, this usually results in junk files and possibly weird errors.
  - `watch`, `start`, `start:nc`: Starts the development environment, your code will automatically compile on save
  - `compile`, `compile:nc`: Only compiles the code, doesn't make documentation
  - `docs`, `docs:nc`: Only makes documentation, doesn't compile code
  - `build`, `build:nc`: Builds both documentation and distribution
  - `cleanup`: This script is ran by other scripts, but this deletes `dist/` and `docs/`
  - `test`: Just tests the whole library

### You're ready!
